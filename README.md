#Nickel2Calendar

Nickel2Calendar is a Python Script that runs with BogDevil13's Discord Scheduler to create:

1. an image (discord/twitter friendly) of my schedule per week based on times (24 hour) and what I plan to stream that day.
2. Uses Flask Webserver to generate a GUI based on [BogDevil13's Discord Scheduler](https://discord-schedule-generator.netlify.app/) in order to return a Discord message that is timezone friendly.

I worked on a lot of this on stream at [Twitch.tv/Nickel2Sulfate](https://twitch.tv/Nickel2Sulfate) but I don't often stream programming.
